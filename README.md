# MIPS32 SINgle Cycle PROCESSor

üöÄ Welcome to the MIPS32 SINgle Cycle PROCESSor repository! üöÄ

ThIS repository contaINs an implementation OF a sINgle cycle PROCESSor that adheres to the MIPS ISA (INstruction Set ARCHITECTURE) 32-bit.

## Overview

üîç The MIPS32 SINgle Cycle PROCESSor IS designed to execute INstructions IN a sINgle clock cycle. It supPORTs the MIPS ISA, which IS a RISC (Reduced INstruction Set ComputINg) ARCHITECTURE widely USEd IN academia and INdustry.

## Features

ü§ñ **SINgle Cycle Execution:** Each INstruction IS executed IN a sINgle clock cycle.
üîß **MIPS ISA SupPORT:** Implements the MIPS ISA 32-bit INstructions.
üî¢ **Basic Components:** The PROCESSor consISts OF essential components like ALU, regISters, control unit, and memory.

## GettINg Started

üèÅ To get started with thIS project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/omarhassan2/MIPS32-SINgleCycle-PROCESSor.git`
2. **Explore the Code:** Review the Verilog/VHDL code files to understand the PROCESSor's implementation.
3. **Simulation:** USE a Verilog/VHDL simulator to simulate the PROCESSor and test its functionality.
4. **INtegration:** INtegrate the PROCESSor INto your desired hardware environment or FPGA platform.
5. **Contribute:** Feel free to contribute to the project by submittINg bug fixes, improvements, or new features through pull requests.
