# MIPS32 Single Cycle Processor

🚀 Welcome to the MIPS32 Single Cycle Processor repository! 🚀

This repository contains an implementation of a single cycle processor that adheres to the MIPS ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) 32-bit.

## Overview

🔍 The MIPS32 Single Cycle Processor is designed to execute instructions in a single clock cycle. It supports the MIPS ISA, which is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture widely used in academia and industry.

## Features

🛠 **Single Cycle Execution:** Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.
🔧 **MIPS ISA Support:** Implements the MIPS ISA 32-bit instructions.
🔢 **Basic Components:** The processor consists of essential components like ALU, registers, control unit, and memory.

## Getting Started

🏁 To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MIPS32-SingleCycle-Processor.git`
2. **Explore the Code:** Review the Verilog/VHDL code files to understand the processor's implementation.
3. **Simulation:** Use a Verilog/VHDL simulator to simulate the processor and test its functionality.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the processor into your desired hardware environment or FPGA platform.
5. **Contribute:** Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting bug fixes, improvements, or new features through pull requests.
