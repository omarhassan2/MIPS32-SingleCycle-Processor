# MIPS32 Single Cycle Processor

🚀 Welcome to the MIPS32 Single Cycle Processor repository! 🚀

This repository contains an implementation of a single cycle processor that adheres to the MIPS ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) 32-bit.

## Overview

🔍 The MIPS32 Single Cycle Processor is designed to execute instructions in a single clock cycle. It supports the MIPS ISA, which is a RisC (Reduced instruction Set Computing) architecture widely used in academia and industry.

## Features

🤖 **Single Cycle Execution:** Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.
🔧 **MIPS ISA Support:** Implements the MIPS ISA 32-bit instructions.
🔢 **Basic Components:** The processor consists of essential components like ALU, registers, control unit, and memory.
